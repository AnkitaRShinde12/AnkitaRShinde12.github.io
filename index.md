## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, working in Dr. Lukasz Witek's lab. My research focuses on developing advanced biomedical scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration and cancer treatment using additive manufacturing techniques.

With a strong foundation in polymer science (MEng in Polymer/Plastics Engineering from ICT Mumbai) and industry experience as a Quality Assurance Engineer, I combine materials expertise with innovative manufacturing approaches to create functional medical devices.

## Research Focus

My current research involves developing 3D-printed composite scaffolds using Fe₃O₄, bioceramic, and biodegradable polymers for dual-purpose applications:
- **Bone regeneration** through biocompatible scaffold design
- **Cancer treatment** via magnetic hyperthermia and controlled drug delivery

Our project has been selected for commercialization through the National Science Foundation (NSF) under the startup **NeoBoneSculpt**.

## Expertise

- **Additive Manufacturing:** Robocasting, FDM, Direct Ink Writing
- **Materials:** Polymer processing, bioceramics, composite materials
- **Design & Analysis:** SolidWorks, ANSYS, MATLAB
- **Characterization:** Mechanical, thermal, chemical, and physical testing
