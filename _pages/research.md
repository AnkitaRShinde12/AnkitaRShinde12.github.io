## Current Research

### Magnetic Scaffolds for Bone Regeneration and Cancer Treatment

In Dr. Witek's lab at NYU, I am developing advanced medical scaffolds that support bone regeneration while providing a novel approach to cancer treatment. My research focuses on creating 3D-printed composite scaffolds combining Fe₃O₄, bioceramic, and biodegradable polymers. The magnetic Fe₃O₄ enables hyperthermia-based cancer therapy, where heat generated by a magnetic field destroys cancer cells. Simultaneously, the scaffold's controlled drug release system delivers anti-cancer drugs directly to the affected area, reducing side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy.

**Commercialization:** This project has been selected by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for commercialization under the startup NeoBoneSculpt.

## Research Projects

### Master's Research: Natural Fiber Composites
Investigated the effect of water absorption on mechanical properties of wheat straw-reinforced polystyrene composites with silane coupling agents. Demonstrated increased tensile strength with fiber loading up to 25 wt.%, contributing to sustainable materials development.

### Bachelor's Research: Petrochemical Processing Optimization
Assessed the impact of diverting First Stage Liquid from EPRU to LPG plants, reducing butane emissions in C2C3 products to 4 wt.% through process optimization at ONGC facilities.
